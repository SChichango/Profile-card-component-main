## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Google fonts

### What I learned

I learned that there are many ways to center content into a page and how to account changes that the user might do in a page in the final design.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```

```css
.socials {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-around;
  border-top: 1px solid hsl(0, 0%, 59%);
  padding: 20px;
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.
